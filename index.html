        <h2>📌 About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve joined 4 CTFs so far — including a National-level CTF where I won 
            <strong>1st place</strong>, organised by NADI x Cybersecurity.

            I studied Computer Science from Form 4 to Form 5, then pursued Foundation in Arts.  
            Now I’m doing my degree in IT majoring in <strong>Computer Forensics</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            My ambition is to become a <strong>CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)</strong>.  
            During my degree, I want to work in entry-level cybersecurity roles so when I do my internship,  
            I’ll be more valuable to employers and already experienced.
